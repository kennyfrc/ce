**FDL - Fonds de Dotation du Libre - Libre Endowment Fund**

FDL - Libre Endowment Fund is a French endowment fund that supports developers and publishers of Free and Open Source software projects. FDL accepts tax-deductible donations to fund specific feature developments for software deemed of general interest.
