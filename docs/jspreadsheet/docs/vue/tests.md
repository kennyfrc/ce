# Testing Jspreadsheet in Vue.js with Jest: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Vue.js Unit Testing with Jest

Unit testing plays a vital role in modern **Vue.js applications** to ensure that components function as expected and to prevent any potential regressions. When working with **Jspreadsheet** and integrating it into **Vue.js**, it's essential to test this functionality thoroughly. This guide will walk you through the process of **setting up unit tests for Jspreadsheet in Vue.js** using **Jest**.

By following this guide, you'll learn how to efficiently integrate and test Jspreadsheet in your **Vue.js project**, ensuring the **reliability** and **performance** of your components.

## Vue.js Testing Environment Setup

In this section, weâ€™ll guide you through setting up a **Vue.js environment** specifically for testing **Jspreadsheet** using **Jest** and **JSDOM**. This will help you create a solid foundation for **running unit tests** for your Jspreadsheet instances.

### Step 1: Clone or Create a Vue.js Project

To begin, you can either clone an existing **Vue.js project** or create a new one using `@vue/cli`. Here's how to get started:

```bash
vue create jspreadsheet-vue-testing
cd jspreadsheet-vue-testing
```

Alternatively, clone our setup from [GitHub](??).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, install the necessary dependencies, including `jspreadsheet`, Jest, and `jest-environment-jsdom`:

```bash
npm install jspreadsheet-ce@5.0.0-beta.3
npm install --save-dev jest@29.7.0 jest-environment-jsdom@29.7.0
```

### Step 3: Configure Jest for Jspreadsheet

To integrate Jspreadsheet properly in a Jest testing environment, you'll need to set up JSDOM. First, create a `jest.setup.js` file in the root of your project:

```javascript
// jest.setup.js

const jspreadsheet = require('jspreadsheet-ce');

  // Code that runs before each test
beforeEach(() => {
    if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
        jspreadsheet.destroyAll();

        if (!global.jspreadsheet && !global.root) {
            global.jspreadsheet = jspreadsheet;

            global.root = document.createElement('div');
            global.root.style.width = '100%';
            global.root.style.height = '100%';

            document.body.appendChild(global.root);
        }
    }
});
```

Next, configure Jest to use this setup by adding the following entry to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures JSDOM will emulate the DOM environment required to run Jspreadsheet within Jest.

### Step 4: Create a Test

Create a folder inside your project if it doesn't exist, then inside this folder create a file named `jspreadsheet.test.js`.

```javascript
// */tests/jspreadsheet.test.js

/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

test("Testing data", () => {
    let instance = jspreadsheet(root, {
        worksheets: [
            {
                data: [
                    ["Mazda", 2001, 2000],
                    ["Peugeot", 2010, 5000],
                    ["Honda Fit", 2009, 3000],
                    ["Honda CRV", 2010, 6000],
                ],
                minDimensions: [4, 4],
            },
        ],
    });

    expect(instance[0].getValue("A1", true)).toEqual("Mazda");
    expect(instance[0].getValue("A2", true)).toEqual("Peugeot");
    expect(instance[0].getValue("B1", true)).toEqual("2001");
});
```

This test verifies that a basic Jspreadsheet instance is created and that the data values are correctly placed. You can modify it to check for more specific scenarios as needed.

## Running the Tests

Ensure you add the following line to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

```json
"test": "jest"
```

After creating your tests and updating `package.json`, you can run them using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Jest will run all the tests in your project and display the results in the console. If everything is configured correctly, your tests should pass.
