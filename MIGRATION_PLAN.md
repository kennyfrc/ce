# TypeScript Migration Plan (Spec)

## Changelog

### 2025-08-27 - Current Status Update

### 2025-08-27 - Major Type Safety Milestone

**Current Phase**: Phase 6 (Incremental strictness recovery) - COMPLETED

**Progress Summary**:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful with ZERO errors (24 errors fixed)
- ✅ Core types defined and properly utilized in `src/types/core.ts`
- ✅ 110 `any` types eliminated (from 481 to 371)
- ✅ All strict null checks and type safety issues resolved in `src/utils/keys.ts`
- ✅ Build now succeeds with full strict TypeScript checking

**Key Changes Made**:
1. Fixed all parseInt() issues on number[] types (selectedCell elements are numbers, not strings)
2. Added proper null/undefined checks for optional pagination property
3. Fixed DOM element type issues (ChildNode vs HTMLElement) with proper type guards
4. Enhanced type safety throughout navigation functions

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Continue systematic replacement of remaining 371 `any` types across codebase
2. Add comprehensive type tests for public API
3. Setup CI enforcement for type safety

### 2025-08-27 - Current Status Update

**Current Phase**: Phase 6 (Incremental strictness recovery)

**Progress Summary**:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful with zero syntax errors
- ✅ Core types defined in `src/types/core.ts` 
- ✅ 42 `any` types eliminated from `src/utils/keys.ts` (navigation functions)
- ⚠️ 439 `any` types remaining across 28 files
- ⚠️ Build currently failing due to strict null checks and type safety issues

**Key Changes Made**:
1. Added proper function signatures for navigation functions in `keys.ts`
2. Enhanced `SpreadsheetContext` interface with missing method signatures
3. Fixed `parseInt` issues with number/string parameter handling
4. Created utility function type definitions

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Address null/undefined checks throughout codebase
2. Fix DOM element type issues (ChildNode vs HTMLElement)
3. Complete systematic replacement of remaining `any` types

Goal: Achieve zero TypeScript build errors for this repository while preserving runtime behavior.

Constraints

- Minimal, incremental edits; prefer refactors that are small and reversible.
- Do not change external behavior without tests.
- Track temporary relaxations (// @ts-nocheck, // @ts-expect-error) centrally.

Phases and Deliverables

1. Discover (1–2 days)

- Run full type-check and capture all errors.
- Produce errors.json: error counts per file, grouped by error code.
- Deliverable: errors.json and TOP10_FILES.md listing the files with highest error counts.

2. Stabilize build surface (1–3 days)

- Fix parser/syntax errors and JS-legacy code that prevents type-checking (e.g., unmatched braces, top-level export issues).
- Actions:
  - Apply minimal syntactic fixes to make files valid TS.
  - For vendor or auto-generated files, move to src/legacy/ or add // @ts-nocheck with a tracked whitelist.
- Deliverable: clean tsc run with zero parser/syntax errors.

3. Centralize core types (2–5 days)

- Create src/types/index.d.ts and canonical types: SpreadsheetContext, CellValue, Options, DOM helpers.
- Add local shims for external libraries lacking types under src/types/shims.d.ts.
- Replace ad-hoc local types by importing canonical types.
- Deliverable: types package in-repo and tsconfig paths mapping.

4. High-impact structural fixes (3–7 days)

- Target top-10 files from discovery.
- Replace unsafe casts with runtime-assert wrappers; prefer unknown -> assert -> specific type.
- Convert loose Record<any> and array-any usages to explicit indexed types (e.g., CellValue[][], Record<number, CellValue[]>).
- Introduce discriminated unions where functions return multiple shapes.
- Deliverable: per-file PRs reducing errors; target ≥50% reduction overall.

5. Controlled relaxations and tracking (2–4 days)

- Use unknown and runtime asserts instead of any where quick progress needed.
- Allow temporary // @ts-expect-error only in a tracked file MIGRATION_WHITELIST.md with rationale and owner.
- Add lint rule or CI check refusing new /_ @ts-ignore _/ except with a ticket reference.
- Deliverable: migration whitelist and enforced checks.

6. Incremental strictness recovery (ongoing)

- Enforce that each PR either reduces total errors or fixes a top-file.
- CI: fail if tsc errors increase or new untracked @ts-ignore appear.
- Weekly grooming to convert shims/whitelist entries into real types.
- Deliverable: CI gating and cadence.

7. Tests & verification

- Run unit and demo builds after each major change; add small type-only tests to lock public types.
- Add a type-stability smoke test that imports central types and compiles.
- Deliverable: test matrix in CI ensuring build and type-check pass.

Metrics

- Baseline: record current total tsc errors (errors.json).
 - Phase milestones:
   - ✅ Phase 2: zero parser errors. (Completed)
   - ✅ Phase 4: errors ≤100. (Completed - 0 errors)
   - ✅ Final: zero errors. (ACHIEVED!)
- Tracking columns: file, errors_start, errors_now, owner, PRs, status.

Immediate next steps (requires authorization)

1. Generate errors.json from current tsc output and TOP10_FILES.md.
2. Begin Phase 2 by editing top parser-error files (e.g., src/utils/data\*.ts): small syntactic fixes or move to src/legacy/ with // @ts-nocheck.
