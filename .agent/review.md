- The input doesn't work. Right now, when i press + and -, it just inserts the character and it does not fire as input. It seems to append at the end. Perhaps it is wise to actually run the binary yourself and try to run it yourself.
- The mouse events when I hover over the terminal, it seems to fire stuff but it's strange characters
- Be aware of the device taht you're using (MacOS). Feel free to search using brave / fetch to get more info on how to solve these problems.

Input is still not working. Firing 'q' does not work in the counter program. For the simple example, again, +++ and --- gives me this:


```

To quit sooner press 'q' or ctrl-c...
qqq^C
(base) kennyfrc zig build run-simple
Count: 0
Input:
Press 'q' to quit, '+' to increment, '-' to decrement+++-----
```

You see it? 

Please use terminalcp MCP to debug your issues.

Overall, there's progress with plus and minus. I am correctly seeing an increment and a decrement. The other issue I'm seeing right now is that when I press Q, it doesn't quit at all. Some fixes need to happen there. I'm guessing that you are not sending the right signal to the process because at the moment it's not actually quitting. I expect both Q and Ctrl+C to correctly send a termination signal or a quit signal. With that being said, it needs to be graceful and all that type of stuff, but I'm guessing that the missing piece here is a proper termination signal.

I'm still getting some problems when I enter q. Specifically, small letter q, not big letter Q. But Control+C now works. So I think there needs to be a way for us to bind or link q with Control+C because my expectation is that they should behave similarly.

Please use the terminalcp tool to identify / diagnose this. terminalcp is also a cli, so I think you can build an E2E test around this.
