### 2025-08-28 — Webpack tsconfig change

- Added `tsconfig.webpack.json` and pointed `ts-loader` at it to restrict compilation to `src/` (removes TS6059 noise).
- Initially added `noEmit: true` but reverted because ts-loader requires emission for webpack; removed `noEmit`.
- Build now shows many TypeScript diagnostics (expected) but no TS6059; next: tighten core types (SpreadsheetOptions/WorksheetInstance).

### 2025-08-28 — Core types

- Enriched `SpreadsheetOptions` with `worksheets`, `plugins`, `tabs`, `root`, `fullscreen`, and improved `style` typing to match runtime usage.
- Typed `SpreadsheetInstance.config` and `WorksheetInstance.config` as `SpreadsheetOptions` which removed several `TS18046` unknown-type errors in factory.ts.
- Guarded `spreadsheetStyles` in `factory.ts` to avoid `undefined` when indexing and fixed a few type issues surfaced by `tsc`.

### 2025-08-28 — Public API typing

- Removed an `any` cast from `src/index.ts` by assigning the entry function as `JSpreadsheet` and avoiding `as any`.
- Replaced `HelperFn`'s explicit `any` usage with `unknown` in `src/types/core.ts` and adjusted helper registrations to `as unknown as HelperFn`.


### 2025-08-28 — DOM typings

- Added typed `HTMLElement.tabs` and `HTMLElement.contextmenu` via `import('jsuites')` aliases in `src/types/global.d.ts` to avoid `any` and surface accurate controller types.
- Resolved `TS2339` errors in `src/utils/factory.ts` and reduced type noise when accessing jSuites controller instances on elements.


### Baseline metrics (2025-08-28T11:27:29Z)

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 558 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 262 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

### Learnings / Next steps

- Events.ts and internal.ts are major hotspots — prioritize precise WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext unification before narrowing anys.
- Replace many `this: any` usages with explicit context types and prefer `unknown` + guards when surface types are unclear.
 - Add small type-only tests for public API and iterate per-file to avoid large, risky commits.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T11:27:29Z

- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 262 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings (automated snapshot):
- Focus fixes on null-safety and this-context in events.ts and internal.ts — these are the largest error sources.
- Prefer unknown + type guards over any; add small type-only tests for public API edges.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T11:37:54Z

- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 261 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
- Narrowing public typedefs can reduce the explicit any count quickly; next: events.ts hotspots.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T11:45:28Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 558 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 261 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
- events.ts and internal.ts remain primary hotspots; focus WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext unification.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T12:13:02Z

 - TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 673 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
 - Explicit any count (find-any-types): 230 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
 - events.ts remains the largest error source; next step: unify WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext types in src/types/core.ts and src/utils/events.ts.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T12:33:40Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 673 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 229 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Changes performed:
- Updated src/utils/events.ts to call setWidth on the spreadsheet/worksheet parent context where appropriate to reduce type mismatch.
- Ran the any-types analyzer and TypeScript type-check; outputs saved under .agent/.

Next steps:
- Continue typing hotspots in src/utils/events.ts (null-safety and EventTarget narrowing) and reconcile WorksheetInstance vs SpreadsheetContext in src/types/core.ts.
 
### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T13:53:06Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 586 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 229 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
- events.ts remains the primary hotspot; prioritize narrowing EventTarget/e.target and guarding optional fields.
- Added targeted in-progress task to narrow events.ts typings and unify WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext.

Next steps:
- Continue narrowing and add small type-only tests for public API edges.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T13:10:08Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 669 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 229 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
- Ran baseline metrics now; events.ts remains the largest hotspot. Next: start precise WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext unification and EventTarget narrowing in src/utils/events.ts.


### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T12:49:09Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 676 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 229 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Changes performed:
- Ran TypeScript type-check and the any-types analyzer; outputs saved under .agent/.

Next steps:
- Continue typing hotspots in src/utils/events.ts (null-safety and EventTarget narrowing) and reconcile WorksheetInstance vs SpreadsheetContext in src/types/core.ts.

### Work: 2025-08-28T14:00:00Z

- Narrowed EventTarget usage in src/utils/events.ts, added HTMLElement guards, parsed coordinate attributes to numbers, and loosened updateSelectionFromCoords origin type to accept Event values. Committed changes (types/events).

Next: continue guarding optional indexes and unify WorksheetInstance/SpreadsheetContext to resolve remaining strict-mode diagnostics.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T14:11:59Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 517 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 232 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Learnings:
- events.ts remains a large hotspot; will continue narrowing EventTarget and adding null guards.

### Snapshot: 2025-08-28T14:27:27Z

- TypeScript errors (tsconfig.test.json --noEmit): 506 (saved to .agent/ts-errors.txt)
- Explicit any count (find-any-types): 232 (saved to .agent/any-types-report.txt)

Changes performed:
- Fixed typeof checks in getMouseButton and used it for contextMenuControls to avoid legacy-event branches.
- Guarded dragging.element before DOM insert and adjusted WorksheetInstance.parent to SpreadsheetInstance to match runtime usage.

Learnings:
- Capturing stable local references and adding narrow guards quickly reduces 'possibly null' diagnostics.
- Small, focused edits across hotspots (events.ts) give fast wins; next step: centralize local 'current' references in hot functions.
